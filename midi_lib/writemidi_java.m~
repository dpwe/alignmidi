function writemidi_java(nm, filename, tpq, tempo,...
    tsig1, tsig2, patches)
% Writes a midi file just as writemidi from the matlab midi 
% toolbox.  Please note that this function ignores the 6th & 
% 7th columns of nm, just like writemidi does.  Also note that 
% there can be only one tempo.
%
%   writemidi_java(nm, filename, tpq, tempo,...
%      tsig1, tsig2, patches);
%
% INPUTS:
%   nm - the note matrix, which has the same form as the note
%     matrix returned by readmidi_java.  It may optionally 
%     include an eighth column with the track numbers for each 
%     note.
%   filename - the name for the resulting midi file.
%   tpq (optional, default 120) - ticks per quarter note
%   tempo (optional, default 100) - beats per minute
%   tsig1, tsig2 (optional, default 4 & 4) - the time signature
%      specified as a fraction.  For example, 3/4 --> tsig1 = 3
%      and tsig2 = 4.
%   patches (optional, default empty) - the patches 
%      (instruments) for each channel.  You can specify a 
%      single instrument for each channel/track combinations.
%      patches should be an Nx3 matrix.  The first column is 
%      the channel, the second column is the track, and the
%      third column is the patch number.  (Note that if you
%      do not supply track numbers in nm, you should pass in
%      an Nx2 matrix without the track number column.)
% 
% NOTES:
%   (1) Channel numbers, track numbers, and midi patches begin
%       at 1.  So patch number 1 is the acoustic grand piano.
