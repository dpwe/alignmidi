%% alignmidi - Aligning MIDI files to music audio
%
% To obtain ground-truth transcriptions of real music audio, it is 
% sometimes possible to find a MIDI version of the track which can 
% then be aligned in time.  The time-aligned MIDI events can then 
% be taken as an approximate transcription of the audio.  There are 
% several ways to do this, including several choices of the domain 
% in which to do the matching; one popular approach is to
% synthesize the MIDI version to audio, then do a time alignment
% between the original audio and the synthetic audio (see, e.g.,
% Turetsky and Ellis ISMIR 2003, or Hu, Dannenberg, and Tzanetakis,
% WASPAA, 2003). 
%
% This matlab code refines that approach by first beat tracking both the 
% original audio and the resynthesized MIDI, then doing the time 
% warp alignment over units of complete beats.  Since the remapping 
% of MIDI event times will be done using each beat as an anchor
% point, the temporal precision is usually good (as long as the 
% beat tracker worked.
%% Example usage
% The code below shows how to run the alignment using the main
% <alignmidi.m alignmidi> routine, and a couple of ways of
% how the outputs can be used. 
% We will use a modified version of Christine Smit's readmidi_java
% from http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~csmit/karaoke_midi.html .
% If this doesn't work, you need to make sure KaraokeMidJava.jar
% is in Matlab's classpath.txt
if exist('readmidi_java') ~= 2; ...
addpath(['midi_lib']); end
% The main function takes a MIDI file and an audio file as input
% The third arg is a flag to plot figures, and the fourth is a stem
% for the output midis.
midifile = 'SoS.mid';
wavfile = '06_Sultans_of_Swing.mp3';
doplot = 1;
stem = 'tmp';
alignmidi(midifile,wavfile,doplot,stem);
% With doplot set, the routine already plotted the results. zoom a little
subplot(122)

% A midi file warped to match audio is written to <stem>-mix.mid
outmidi = [stem, '-mix.mid'];
% Let's read it in, and play in stereo
sr = 11025;
domono = 1;
[da,sr] = audioread(wavfile, sr, domono);
[dm,sr] = midireadasaudio(outmidi, sr, domono);
soundsc([da(1:20*sr), dm(1:20*sr)], sr); <A HREF="demo_alignmidi_02.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
%% Comparing Outputs
%
% We can plot log-frequency spectrograms to show the effect and
% quality of the alignment.  Note that the aligned MIDI is not just
% shifted in time, but also scaled appropriately to keep every beat
% time lined up.
% Read original audio
[da,sr] = audioread(wavfile,11025,1);
% Read unaligned MIDI as audio
[dm,sr] = midireadasaudio(midifile,11025,1);
% .. and aligned version
[dma,sr] = midireadasaudio(outmidi,11025,1);
% Now plot
